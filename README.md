# Primes
Some fun playing around with prime numbers. I'm going try to tweak my algorithm generate the first N primes really quickly, and then I'll start to play around. Some fun ideas: 
1. Look for frequency of primes in "buckets" of size B. If B = 100, then how many primes are in [0, 100], [100, 200], etc. 
2. Look for frequency of the last digit
3. Count the number of twin primes, cousin primes, and sexy primes
